# FedUAG
This experiment is based on the scenario of overlapping decentralized nodes. It not only uses secure multi-party computation to obtain global nodes adjacency relationship, but also uses differential privacy to perturb model parameters. There are six clients of this experiment, and the client communicaiton was through socketIO-client. 

The environment of this experiment is as follow:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* flask
* flask_socketio
* tensorflow
